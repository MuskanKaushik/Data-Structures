The following repository consists of Data Structure And Algorithms.

âœ¨ ARRAYS

1.) Searching : 

--> Linear Search - Linear Search is used to search an element from multiple elements.
    Complexity    - The best case is O(n) (when the element is present at first index).
                    The worst case complexity is O(n) (when element is present at last index).
                    
--> Binary Search - Binary Search is used to find an element from multiple elements. It is much faster than Linear Search.
    Complexity    - The best case is O(n) (when the element is present at middle index at first).
                    The complexity is  O(logn).

2.) Sorting :

--> Bubble Sort - Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting technique in java to sort array elements. The idea is to traverse the array from starting elememt to the last element by 
                  camparing the adjacent elements and swapping them if they are not in specific order.
    Complexity  - The Worst and average case complexity is O(n2).
                  The best case complexity is O(n) (when the array is already sorted ).
                  
--> Insertion Sort - Insertion Sort is a simple algorithm that works the way we sort playing card in our hands. We choose one card and insert it in its position (ascending or                          descending).
    Complexity     - The worst and average time complexity is O(n2).
                     The best case time complexity is O(n).
                    
--> Selection Sort - Selection Sort is the combination of searching and sorting. It sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from 
                     unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to                          sorted subarray.
    Complexity     - The time complexity is O(n2).
