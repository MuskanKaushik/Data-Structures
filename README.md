1.) Searching : 

--> Linear Search - Linear Search is used to search an element from multiple elements.
    Complexity    - The best case is O(n) (when the element is present at first index).
                    The worst case complexity is O(n) (when element is present at last index).
                    
--> Binary Search - Binary Search is used to find an element from multiple elements. It is much faster than Linear Search.
    Complexity    - The best case is O(n) (when the element is present at middle index at first).
                    The complexity is  O(logn).
